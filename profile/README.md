This organisation hosts the code, models and analytical tools underpinning our work.

## Why we share our code

We are public servants, delivering public services.

We are therefore committed to maximising the public value of our work. A key part of this commitment is sharing our analytical methods and outputs openly wherever possible.

This may include:
- Economic evaluation models  
- Analytical and statistical code  
- Methods documentation  
- Dashboards and visualisations  
- Reports and technical appendices  

Sharing our work supports transparency, reproducibility and collaboration across the health and care system.

Where governance and information governance requirements allow, our default position is to publish and disseminate our outputs through our website, GitHub and professional networks.
